# vstat
This utility is designed to be an assistant to all Linux users using BASH.

## Overview
Running this script will present the user with helpful and important system information. This script makes use of utilites that should already be present on a most Linux distributions. This script has been tested on a Ubuntu-based distribution and should work with most flavours of Linux which are similar to Ubuntu. 

The script provides a menu interface for the user, where they can select each function using numbers on their keyboard. This script was created to work as a piece of training material for the BASH programming language for me. Hopefully, by the end of this I can be a bit more confident in scripting in BASH.

## Dependencies
